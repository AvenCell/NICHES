)
}
\arguments{
\item{sys.small}{A filtered Seurat object. The active identity will be used to define populations for connectomic sampling and crossings.}

\item{ground.truth}{Ground truth signaling mechanisms present in sys.small.}

\item{assay}{The assay to run the SCC transformation on. Defaults to "RNA."}

\item{meta.data.to.map}{A character vector of metadata names present in the original object which will be carried to the NICHES objects}

\item{edgelist}{data.frame. Each row is an directional edge between two spatially connected cells}
